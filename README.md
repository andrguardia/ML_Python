# Machine Learning using Python

This repository consists on the work I performed when taking the course: ML with Python from the IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificate. 

It includes various mini-projects on the following topics: 

## **Regression**

  Linear regression
  
  Non-Linear Regression
  
## **Classification**

  K-Nearest Neighbors

  Decision Trees
  Logistic Regression
  Support Vector Machines
## **Clustering**

  k-Means Clustering
  Hierarchical Clustering
  Density Based Clustering
  
## **Final Project**

**Description**: This project consists on the development of four ML classification models: kNN, Decision Tree, SVM and Linear Regression to predict loan default rates. The models are developed using the IBM Watson studio, and their accurracy is evaluated using the Jaccard Score and the F1 Index (LogLoss is used on Linear Regression as well). These results are presented on a table at the end of the notebook. Thank you for a great course and a great learning experience!
